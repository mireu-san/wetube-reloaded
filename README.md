- Personal note:
1. npm install -g --save-dev @babel/node is missing?
- can be found this from Nodemon (utilities)

1.1 What is this? [type: supervisor]
This nodemon supports project to works like react.js - '(simultaneously reflect)dynamically compile' it as soon as saving any changes of its file.
